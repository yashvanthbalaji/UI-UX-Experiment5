**Step 4: Select Research Methods**
Pick suitable methods like interviews, surveys, usability tests, or field studies.

**Step 5: Justify Methods**
Explain how each method helps discover user behavior and issues.

**Step 6: Create User Personas**
Define user demographics, goals, behaviors, and pain points for each scenario.

**Step 7: Summarize Findings**
Connect pain points, statements, methods, and personas to guide UX decisions.
