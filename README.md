## AIM

To understand how to identify UX problems, choose suitable research methods, and create user personas for two scenarios: a Mental Wellness Companion App and a Smart Waste Management App.

## ALGORITHM 

**Step 1: Understand the Scenario**
Study both app scenarios and identify target users, goals, and UX improvement needs.

**Step 2: Identify User Pain Points**
• Wellness app: stress, emotional tracking issues, lack of personalization.
• Waste app: no schedule clarity, reporting difficulty, poor communication.

**Step 3: Write UX Problem Statements**
Use the template to highlight user needs, obstacles, and impact.

**Step 4: Select Research Methods**
Pick suitable methods like interviews, surveys, usability tests, or field studies.

**Step 5: Justify Methods**
Explain how each method helps discover user behavior and issues.

**Step 6: Create User Personas**
Define user demographics, goals, behaviors, and pain points for each scenario.

**Step 7: Summarize Findings**
Connect pain points, statements, methods, and personas to guide UX decisions.
